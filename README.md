Benchmark JSON streaming serialization performance.

Short story: JSON Streaming performance sucks, now you know, lets make it better.

## Latest run

If you scroll down to throughput you'll see the bigger picture. Streaming is an order
of magnitude worse than simply doing it via built-in JSON stringify/parse.  

***Updated to use Node v4.2.2 and leverage setImmediate for delayed tests for more real-world data***
